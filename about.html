          <h2>J&V Precious began like all great adventures...</h2>
          <p>...with two friends, a lot of laughter, and just enough irresponsibility to try brewing their own mead.<br>
Vasco "Zarmaug" Fernandes and João "Turin" Correia were bound by destiny — and by a shared obsession with The Lord of the Rings. <br>
Instead of setting out to destroy a dark artifact, they chose a nobler quest: to create magical drinks worthy of elves, dwarves, and second breakfasts.<br>
Armed with questionable equipment, ancient (Googled) recipes, and heroic levels of patience, they now craft homemade meads and liqueurs that taste like something straight 
out of the Green Dragon Inn—if the Green Dragon Inn also had a mild explosion or two during fermentation.<br>
